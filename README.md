# Web Design Challenge: Web Visualization Dashboard 

**Summary:** This homework assignment takes what we have learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the WeatherPy analysis homework.

This dashboard consists of 7 pages and includes easy-to-use navigation.  The following pages and navigation tools are included in this dashboard:

* Landing Page with an explanation of the project and a visualization navigation panel on the right side of the page
* Four visualization pages with a descriptive title, heading tag, visualization, and summary paragraph.  The visualization pages include:
  * Max temperature
  * Humidity
  * Cloudiness
  * Wind Speed
* Comparisons page with all four visualizations using a Bootstrap grid
* Data page that contains a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations
* Navigation bar at the top of each page that allows for easy navigation to the home page, visualization pages, comparison page, and the data page.

The website has been deployed and is available via GitHub pages:  https://christypatrick.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/WebVisualizations/index.html
